## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a second-year Industrial-Organizational Psychology Ph.D. student in the [OWL Lab](https://workforce.rice.edu/) at [Rice University](https://psychology.rice.edu/graduate/industrial-organizational-psychology), advised by [Prof. Fred Oswald](https://profiles.rice.edu/faculty/fred-oswald) and [Prof. Tianjun Sun](https://profiles.rice.edu/faculty/tianjun-sun) (Co-Advised). Prior to this, I received my B.S. in Psychology and B.A. in Computer Science, both with high distinction, from the [University of Minnesota-Twin Cities](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/), where I had the privilege of working with [Prof. Richard Landers](https://cla.umn.edu/about/directory/profile/lande065), [Prof. Deniz Ones](https://cla.umn.edu/about/directory/profile/onesx001), and [Prof. Gail Ferguson](https://icd.umn.edu/gail-ferguson). 

My primary research interests are centered around leveraging innovative technologies to enhance psychometric assessments and employee selection. I am also interested in advancing open science through the adoption of novel methodologies. My aim is to become an I-O psychologist who is an expert in quantitative analysis, with a keen focus on harnessing machine learning to elevate the accuracy and fairness of psychological measurement and personnel selection systems. 

I am always excited to collaborate with other researchers and explore new fields. Do not hesitate to contact me if you are interested!
