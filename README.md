## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Hi, I am Pengda Wang, a third-year Psychology Ph.D. student at Rice University and an ML/AI Ph.D. Resident at Midjourney, Inc. I do research on psychometrics (e.g., SEM, computational measurement, AI/ML approaches), individual differences (e.g., bright/dark personalities, social behaviors), and personnel selection (e.g., faking, bias, AI/ML applications, interpretable/responsible AI use).

I am always excited to collaborate with other researchers and explore new fields. Do not hesitate to contact me (pw32@rice.edu) if you are interested!
